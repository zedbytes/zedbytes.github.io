    <p>Learn Python the Hard Way review
this book is an absolute must for beginner python programmers. Its gets you to code straight away and keeps you on your toes. Its different to some of the other books I have read in that it doesn't go through the theory in depth, its a much more practical approach and makes learning fun. I hope the author writes one for Java because I want to learn that next. I noticed a review below where someone says the author talks to you like your an idiot (the author sounds a bit like an army general in the book), I think this is unfair because Zed Shaw does explain this at the beginning and explicitly say this tone is because the book is aimed for absolute beginners who have no programming knowledge. The author also makes you go away and research a lot of things online, I like this approach because I have been told this is how programmers are trained. Whenever I ask questions on programming forums like stackoverflow I am told to go and read the python documentation, so thats the nature of the game. I think the author tries to embed this habit in the reader from the beginning. I am about half way through and really enjoying it!!</p>
<p>Dive into Python
This book is perfectly aimed at people who have some experience of programming. It takes for granted that you are familiar with basic concepts of programming in general and object-oriented programming in particular, and gets on with telling you how Python works.
The structure is very hands-on - showing you how to accomplish particular tasks in a very fast, but clear, way.
What I found was that this book finally persuaded me as to Python's strengths.
On top of that it's very readable, and well supported by useful examples that are readily applicable to real world problems.</p>
